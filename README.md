#### The Project (Updated)
The project was started Apr. 18, 2018.  It is now May 30st.  Almost all of the code is written.  What remains is support-kind of stuff, including options to control the JACK server (sample rate, etc)--the hard stuff having been completed.  The driver now works with JACK and JACK2.  When the code is ready for beta release, it will be available on GitHub along with docs.  Check the **Status Report** on the [Projects](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio/projects) page.  Thanks for your interest!
